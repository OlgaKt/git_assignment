e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a local version control system that is used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows users to create branches, make changes, commit those changes, merge branches, and revert to previous versions. 
GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git. It allows users to share their code, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source projects.

f. What does git diff do?
It allows to compare files

g. What is the main branch?
The main branch is the default branch in a Git repository.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
No, we need to create a new branch where we can work on a new feature and make changes.
